# Open Source Projects Site

This project is a work-in-progress; the goal is to create a website where:

1.  _developers_, _aspiring developers_, _bootcampers_, or _anyone else_
2.  who has an _idea_ for a _web app or other coding project_, or has already begun a project,
3.  can _share_ their idea with potential collaborators, or just put it out there for anyone else to build.

This site will be for you if:

- You have one or more ideas for an app or website, and would like to build it with others, or just share it
- You worked on a solo or group project in a coding bootcamp, and want that project to continue, but can't do it all yourself
- You want to get involved with open source, but have had trouble getting started
- You want to work on open source projects, like web apps, that aren't just for developers

## Minimum Viable Product Must-haves and Maybe-haves

- Users need to be able to submit ideas, or current projects
- Users should be able to post, or submit, links to works-in-progress
- Each idea or project needs to have basic info: a title, a brief description, whether or not it's already in-progress, and if so, a link to its repo
- The home page should have a simple list view of all current projects, with the appropriate info and links
- Info about how to start a project based on an idea, and post (or submit) a link to it
- (Maybe) A link to my (or somebody else's, if a good one exists) open source skeleton
- Need to decide whether idea submissions will be owned by their submitters, if so, they should not be deletable after someone has started and linked a project
- Projects, and if applicable, their pages should be owned by individual users
- If projects have a link to a working demo, in addition to a repo, that link should appear either on the list view, or on the project's page ( only if every project, by default, has its own page)
- Need to decide whether users need to have profile pages for the MVP
- If voting is allowed, need to decide how to permit voting--users only? is there a way to verify users, or to semi-verify, maybe through a connected app, like Github?
- (Maybe) Each project can have a dedicated page, with more details
- (Maybe) For works-in-progress, maybe allow thumbnails to be attached to
- (Maybe) Allow users to vote for specific ideas, to push them closer to the top and make them easier to find
- (Maybe) There should probably be a way to link to more than one work-in-progress for a specific idea
- (Maybe) Allow users to vote for specific projects if an idea has more than one work-in-progress
