# Open Source Projects Site

This project is a work-in-progress; the goal is to create a website where:

1.  _developers_, _aspiring developers_, _bootcampers_, or _anyone else_
2.  who has an _idea_ for a _web app or other coding project_, or has already begun a project,
3.  can _share_ their idea with potential collaborators, or just put it out there for anyone else to build.

This site will be for you if:

- You have one or more ideas for an app or website, and would like to build it with others, or just share it
- You worked on a solo or group project (perhaps in a coding bootcamp), and want that project to continue, but can't do it all yourself
- You want to get involved with open source, but have had trouble getting started
- You want to work on open source projects, like web apps, that aren't just for developers
