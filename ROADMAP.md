# Steps to a Minimum Viable Project

- Users need to be able to submit ideas, or current projects
- Users should be able to post, or submit, links to works-in-progress
- Each idea or project needs to have basic info: a title, a brief description, whether or not it's already in-progress, and if so, a link to its repo
- The home page should have a simple list view of all current projects, with the appropriate info and links
- Info about how to start a project based on an idea, and post (or submit) a link to it
- (Maybe) A link to my (or somebody else's, if a good one exists) open source skeleton
- Need to decide whether idea submissions will be owned by their submitters, if so, they should not be deletable after someone has started and linked a project
- Projects, and if applicable, their pages should be owned by individual users
- If projects have a link to a working demo, in addition to a repo, that link should appear either on the list view, or on the project's page ( only if every project, by default, has its own page)
- Need to decide whether users need to have profile pages for the MVP
- If voting is allowed, need to decide how to permit voting--users only? is there a way to verify users, or to semi-verify, maybe through a connected app, like Github?
- (Maybe) Each project can have a dedicated page, with more details
- (Maybe) For works-in-progress, maybe allow thumbnails to be attached to
- (Maybe) Allow users to vote for specific ideas, to push them closer to the top and make them easier to find
- (Maybe) There should probably be a way to link to more than one work-in-progress for a specific idea
- (Maybe) Allow users to vote for specific projects if an idea has more than one work-in-progress
- Allow submitting of proposed projects, to lower the bar for project submission, so the owner doesn't have to learn and go through all the steps of setting it up as an OS project; someone else who's interested in the project and has the know-how can set up a bare bones repo, and then either:
  1.  allow the owner to submit their project as a pull request, or
  2.  they could clone the project if the owner includes an OS license.
- At some point add tutorials:
  1.  How to submit a project or idea, what happens next, etc.
  2.  How to make your first contribution (pull request)--maybe link to this great video walk-through of making a PR on Github: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTbRzhQju4c
